## [Unreleased] - 2026-01-17 23:35:24

### Added
- **Payments:** Introduced Payment Abstraction Layer (Payment Provider Pattern) supporting multiple processors.
- **Payments:** Added `PaymentProviderInterface`, `PaymentProviderFactory`, and DTOs (`PaymentIntentResult`, `WebhookEvent`, `PaymentUpdate`, `RefundResult`, `ProviderCapabilities`).
- **Payments:** Added `StripeProvider` implementation (ported from legacy service) and skeleton providers for PayPal, Square, Authorize.net, Amazon Pay.
- **Payments:** Formalized project-centric payments system in database (`booking_date`, `payment_status`, etc. in `ap_projects`).
- **Payments:** Added `ap_payment_events` table for audit logging of payment webhooks and actions.
- **Payments:** Implemented robust `PaymentService` with idempotency, detailed logging, and support for `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_failed`, and `refunded` webhooks.
- **Payments:** Added REST endpoints for Admin UI: `GET /projects/{id}/payment-summary`, `GET /projects/{id}/payment-timeline`, `POST /projects/{id}/retry-payment`.
- **Admin UI:** Added `PaymentCard` SPA component and `usePaymentSummary` hook.
- **Admin UI:** Added "Command Center" page with payment summary integration.
- **Workflow:** Added `Workflow::onPaymentReceived` trigger.
- Added `ProofCache` service to cache signed proof URLs, reducing redundant signing operations and improving response times for large galleries.
- Added `existsMany` method to `StorageInterface` and all drivers (`LocalStorage`, `S3Storage`, `CloudinaryStorage`, `ImageKitStorage`) to support batch existence checks.
- Added `ProofService::getProofUrls` for batch proof URL generation.
- Added client-side SPA routing with internal link interception in `assets/spa/bootstrap.js`.
- Persisted client image selection in `ClientProofController`.
- Persisted client image comments in `ClientProofController`.
- Added transactional email queue system to handle failed email sends in the background without blocking user requests.
- Implemented `CloudinaryStorage` driver with chunked upload support (64MB).
- Formalized `StorageInterface` contract with `upload`, `delete`, `getUrl`, `getStats`, `getName`.
- Added `getStats` method to all storage drivers for uniform health reporting.

### Changed
- **Payments:** Refactored `PaymentService` to be provider-agnostic, delegating logic to drivers.
- **Payments:** Updated `PaymentController` to support dynamic webhook routes `/webhooks/payment/{provider}`.
- Performance: Refactored `ClientProofController::list_proofs` to use batch proof generation and caching, eliminating N+1 storage existence checks and redundant signing (approx 50x speedup for cold cache, instant for warm cache).
- Performance: Offloaded proof generation to a background queue. Requests for missing proofs now return a placeholder immediately instead of blocking until generation completes.
- Optimized `CloudinaryStorage::existsMany` to use the Admin API `resources` endpoint for true batch checking.
- Optimized `EmailService::sendTemplate` to remove blocking `sleep()` and retry loop; failed emails are now immediately queued for background processing.
- Optimized `Watchdog` maintenance task by instantiating storage driver once instead of per-session.
- Refactored `LocalStorage`, `S3Storage`, and `ImageKitStorage` to adhere to the strict `StorageInterface` contract.
- Refactored `ProofService` to use standardized storage methods (`upload`, `getUrl`) and handle exceptions robustly.
- Updated `HealthService` to use `StorageInterface::getStats()` for retrieving storage metrics, removing driver-specific logic.
- Deprecated `putFile` and `list` methods in `StorageInterface` (removed from interface definition, though some drivers may still have helpers).

### Removed
- Deleted `inc/ajax-health-endpoint.php` as it is now superseded by the REST API implementation.

### Fixed
- Fixed `register_routes` return type signature in `ClientProofController`.
